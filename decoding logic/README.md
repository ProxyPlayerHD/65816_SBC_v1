# Decoding Logic
This Folder has the entire Logic for the CPLD

My workflow is a bit strange:

* The Circuit was designed and exported to Verilog using [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)
* Quartus II (the free one) was then used to assign the pins and Synthesize the entire thing (MAX7064 = ATF1508)
* POF2JED was used to convert the POF file generated by Quartus to a JED file
* and finally, ATMISP was used to actually program the CPLD using the JED file

this process works surprisingly well.

# Files

* CPLD-MAIN.dig  
the main file containing the Bulk of the Logic, Quartus needs to be told that "CPLD-MAIN" is the top module
* CPLD-MAIN.jed  
a premade JED file, in case you don't want to go through the whole process of making your own
* latch.dig
* latch8.dig
* LFSR.dig  
Seperate files for the Latching and RNG Circuits, as an attempt to keep the mess of the main file smaller
